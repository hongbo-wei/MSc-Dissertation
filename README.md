# MSc-Dissertation BoxingHub: AI-powered Web Platform for Boxing
Knowledge and Training Enhancement

## Abstract
Currently, there is no one-stop platform for all boxing resources. BoxingHub addresses this gap by providing
an AI-powered web platform that promotes boxing knowledge and training enhancement. The platform
leverages advanced technologies, including computer vision for boxing punch detection and classification, a
rule-based chatbot for interactive learning, a large language model to generate endless texts of affirmation,
and accessibility features for users with hearing impairments. These functionalities aim to deliver a
personalised and inclusive learning experience. Evaluations show significant improvements in user
engagement and training effectiveness, highlighting the potential of AI in transforming sports education.
